## File Structure
- `index.html`: Homepage with hero, highlights, destinations, activities, and footer.

## Notes
- The `js/translations.js` file is assumed to handle internationalization for `data-i18n` attributes.
- The `js/script.js` file is assumed to manage interactivity (e.g., hamburger menu toggle).
- Placeholder links (e.g., "Explore More", social media) require backend integration for functionality.
- The background video should be optimized for web to reduce load times.
- Ensure CORS support for external resources if hosted on a server.
- The site assumes static content; dynamic features (e.g., booking) need additional backend setup.
